# Temporal_CONV and Catroy_Pool

Temporal_CONV and Catroy_Pool for GCN

This project is based on one of our studies for medical image analysis

These two modular approaches are an important part of our model Temporal Brain Category Graph Convolutional Network (Temporal-BCGCN)

In this research we have developed a convolution kernel and a pooling kernel based on GCN.

Here we provide the module code for this convolutional pooling kernel

The project follows the Pytorch library at https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

If you want to run the project directly, it is recommended that you follow the settings of this library
