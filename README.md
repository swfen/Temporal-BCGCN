# Temporal_CONV
Temporal_CONV and Catroy_Pool for GCN

This project is based on one of our studies for medical image analysis
In this research we have developed a convolution kernel and a pooling kernel based on GNN.

Here we provide the module code for this convolutional pooling kernel

The project follows the Pytorch library at https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

If you want to run the project directly, it is recommended that you follow the settings of the library
